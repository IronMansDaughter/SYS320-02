4. What was the toughest part of this task, and how did you handle it?

The most challenging part was putting together different PowerShell commands smoothly to collect all the data and figuring out the best choices for the 4 artifacts. To overcome this, I looked into
PowerShell documentation and online questionares that allowed me to learn more. Also youtube is super helpful for tutorials and gaining a better understanding of scripting in general. 


5. What did you enjoy the most about this task, and why?

Creating a PowerShell script to automate data retrieval, incorporating file hashing and archiving, and explaining the cmdlet choices provided hands-on experience and I'll be able to reuse this script
later in life to make my life a bit easier since everything is automated. I really love the fact that the information we are learning in class will actually be useful after college.
